Introduction:

Overview:
In this project, we are measuring the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by analyzing dataframes involving crime, *Enter Ben's dataframe,* and comparing this data with the population density of each neighborhood.

We believed crime would be useful data to look at for this project because crime is very telling of a neighborhood's safety. Safety is very important in determining a desirable neighborhood anywhere. The safer the area, the more likely people are to travel there. Consequently, the more people travelling to a given neighborhood and the safer the neighborhood, the more likely businesses are to open up in the neighborhood, causing the neighborhood to grow, and the community to be satisfied.
