In this project, we are measuring the best neighborhood in oakland by looking at dataframes involving crime, *Enter Ben's dataframe,* and population density.

We believed crime would be useful data to look at for this project because crime is very telling of a neighborhood's safety. Safety is very important in determining the "best" neighborhood anywhere. The safer the area, the more likely people are to travel there. Consequently, the more people travelling to a given neighborhood, and the safer the neighborhood, the more likely businesses are to open up in the neighborhood...(finish)

It is best to think about your final project as a data-driven report. You will need to put everything into a Jupyter notebook with the following structure:

Introduction: Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.


The Metric: Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?
The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.


Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.


There are some key things that need to be included in your repository. Think of this project as a combination of all of the things we learned in skills labs this semester, with a focus on the last few weeks. So, there are some minimum requirements of files and information you will want to put in your group repo.
