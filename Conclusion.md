INTRODUTION 
Our project combines poverty, food access, and crime data to determine neighborhood livability. We also considered looking at average income, but we decided that it would be represented between our poverty and crime data.

Crime, poverty, and food access were the three metrics we used to determine livability, and with this data we concluded that Strip District
